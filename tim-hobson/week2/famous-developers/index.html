      <div class="textContent"><p id='info'>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), The Enchantress of Numbers. <br>
Named Augusta after her Aunt, Middle name Ada, Daughter to Lord and Lady Byron, Married William King-Noel, 1st Earl of LovelaceThen made the countess of Lovelace English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.<br>

Lord Byron was a famous poetHer parents seperated a month after her birth. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity.

She was sick a lot as a child but continued her studies
Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".<br></p></div>
