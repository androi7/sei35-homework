            <h2>Father of Linux</h2>
            <p>
                In 1991, while studying computer science at University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began a project that
                later became the Linux kernel. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and
                independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386
                processor. Development was done on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. The GNU C Compiler is still the main
                choice for compiling Linux today, but can be built with other compilers, such as the Intel C Compiler.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Torvalds wrote in his book Just for Fun,[13] he eventually ended up writing an operating system
                kernel. On 25 August 1991, he (at age 21) announced this system in a Usenet posting to the newsgroup
                "comp.os.minix.":[14]

                    Hello everybody out there using minix -
                    <p></p>
                    I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for
                    386(486)
                    AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on
                    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the
                    file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
                    <p></p>
                    I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get
                    something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want.
                    Any
                    suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
                    <p></p>

                    <p></p>
                    PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386
                    task
                    switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I
                    have :-(.
                    <p></p>

                According to Torvalds, Linux began to gain importance in 1992 after the X Window System was ported to
                Linux by Orest Zborowski, which allowed Linux to support a GUI for the first time.[13]

            <h2>Inventor of Git</h2>
            <p>
                By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature,
                actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous
                creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for
                version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with
                Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a
                wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control
                System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is
                common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every
                developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all
                changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in
                mind.
