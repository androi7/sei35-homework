                Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on 28th December 1969 in Helsinki. He comes from a family of
                journalists.
                His father Nils Torvalds is a Finnish politician and perhaps president candidate in the next elections.

            <h2>
                <li>All the Torvalds in the world are relatives</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                While you may find several people with the name Linus, you won’t find many people with the name
                Torvalds.
                Because the ‘correct’ spelling is actually Torvald (without s). His grandfather changed his name from
                Torvald to Torvalds, adding an ‘s’ at the end. And thus the Torvalds dynasty began (if I can call it
                that).
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this is an unusual surname, there are hardly 30 Torvalds in the world and they are all relatives,
                claims Linus Torvalds in his biography.

            <h2>
                <li>Commodore Vic 20 was his first computer</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 10, Linus started writing programs in BASIC on his maternal grandfather’s Commodore Vic
                20. This is when he discovered his love for computers and programming.

            <h2>
                <li>He created Linux because he didn’t have money for UNIX</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                In early 1991, unhappy with the MS-DOS and MINIX, Torvalds wanted to buy a UNIX system. Luckily for us,
                he didn’t have enough money. So he decided to make his own clone of UNIX, from scratch.
