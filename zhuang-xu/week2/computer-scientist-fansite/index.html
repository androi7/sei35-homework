            <p>
                Linus Torvalds, born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland, created the Linux kernel and oversaw open
                source development of the widely-used Linux operating system.

                Torvalds enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master's degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis
                was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System. An avid computer programmer, Linus authored many gaming applications in his early years. After
                purchasing a personal computer with an Intel 386 CPU, he began using Minix, an Unix-inspired operating
                system created by Andrew Tannenbaum for use as a teaching tool. Torvalds started work on a new kernel,
                later to be named "Linux", in the fall of 1991 and after forming a team of volunteers to work on this new kernel,
                released V1.0 in the spring of 1994.

                In 1996, Torvalds accepted an invitation to visit the California headquarters of Transmeta, a start-up company in the
                first stages of designing an energy saving central processing unit (CPU). Torvalds then accepted a
                position at Transmeta and moved to California with his family. Along with his work for Transmeta,
                Torvalds continued to oversee kernel development for Linux.In 2003, Torvalds left Transmeta to focus
                exclusively on the Linux kernel, backed by the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium formed
                by high-tech companies, which included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, AMD, RedHat, Novell and many others.
                The purpose of the consortium was to promote Linux development. OSDL merged with The Free Standards
                Group in January 2007 to become The Linux Foundation. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what
                new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.
