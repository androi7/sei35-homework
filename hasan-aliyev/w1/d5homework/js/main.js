// Create a program that models a simple subway system.
// The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on
//  at
//  and the line and stop that user is getting off at
//  and prints the journey and the total number of stops
//  for the trip in the console:


// planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd');
// // This is only a suggested function name and signature.
// // console.log() shows output similar to this:
// // "You must travel through the following stops on
// // the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."
// // "Change at Union Square."
// // "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// // "7 stops in total."
// There are 3 subway lines:
// The N line has the following stops:
//  Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
// The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
// The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
// All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square,
// but there are no other intersection points.
// (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N
//   line is different than the 28th street stop on
//   the 6 line, so you might need to differentiate
//   this when you name your stops in the arrays.)
//
// Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops
// IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
//
// // console.log( amazingFrenchAuthors.length );
// // Returns 4 - the length property doesn't use a zero indexâ€‹
// Your trip planner must work in either direction,
// i.e. planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd')
// (starting at Times Square) should work as well as
// the reverse trip planTrip('6', '33rd', 'N', 'Times Square')
// (starting at 33rd).
//
//
//
//
// Hints:
// Work out how you would do it on paper first! Then
// start to explain that process in Javascript.
// Get the program to work for a single line before
// trying to tackle multiple lines.
// Don't worry about prompting the user for input.
// Hard code some values to get it working.
// ou can use prompt() later to make it more interactive.
// Consider diagramming the lines by sketching
// out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
// The key to the lab is finding the index positions
// of each stop. (hint: indexOf())
// Depending on what kind of data structures you use
// to represent the lines and stations, you might have
//
// to make sure the stops that are the same for different
// lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
