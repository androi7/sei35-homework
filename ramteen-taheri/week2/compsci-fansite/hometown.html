                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>
                    English scientist Alan Turing was born Alan Mathison Turing on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, England. At a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which some of his teachers recognized, but did not necessarily respect. When Turing attended the well-known independent Sherborne School at the age of 13, he became particularly interested in math and science.
                    
                    After Sherborne, Turing enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, England, studying there from 1931 to 1934. As a result of his dissertation, in which he proved the central limit theorem, Turing was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation.
                    
                    
                    In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the “Universal Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of computing anything that is computable: It is considered the precursor to the modern computer.
                    
                    Over the next two years, Turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge, and then took a part-time position with the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking organization.

                    During 1936-38, he was taught at the 'Princeton University,' by famous American logician, Alonzo Church. Along with lessons in mathematics, Alan was also taught cryptology. Towards the end of this period, he was able to get his PhD from the university. After this, he was also taught by Ludwig Wittgenstein at the 'University of Cambridge.'

                <h2>Personal Life & Legacy</h2>
                <p>While studying at 'Sherborne School,' Alan befriended his classmate Christopher Morcom, whom he fell in love with. The blossoming friendship ended abruptly when Morcom died of bovine tuberculosis.
                In 1941, he proposed to Joan Clarke, who was his colleague at Bletchley Park. The two got engaged, but the marriage was soon called off as Turing thought it would be unfair to get married to Clarke despite being homosexual.
                At the age of 39, Alan got into a relationship with the 19-year-old Arnold Murray. During a burglary investigation at the mathematician's house, personal details about his homosexuality came into light, and Alan was arrested on charges of indecency.After his conviction in 1952, he was given a choice between hormonal castration and imprisonment. The ingenious logician chose hormonal castration through medication so that he could continue his scientific work at home.
                On June 8, 1954, Alan was found poisoned at home. After the autopsy, it was concluded that he had taken his own life by consuming large quantities of potassium cyanide.
                Several awards have been named after this mathematical genius. Also, many biographies were penned, and the most notable was written by the 'Royal Society.'
                        
                            
                A novel titled 'Cryptonomicon' by American writer Neal Stephenson, published in 1999, has references of this famous mathematician.
                The 2014 movie 'The Imitation Game' was based on Alan's life. In the movie, British actor Benedict Cumberbatch played the mathematician's role.
                Several universities have named their rooms, buildings, and even computer programs after the distinguished mathematician.
                Turing is featured in Ian McEwan's 2019 novel ‘Machines like Me.’
